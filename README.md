## Overview

**Please note that this library is still in Alpha. Expect inconsistent API changes and delayed releases as the library continues to work towards a more stable state.**

`NekoMaid` is a bevy plugin designed to aid in high-level creation and modification of UI layouts for Bevy. This project seeks to replace the default, static nature of the Bevy UI framework, and takes advantages of hot-reloading to make the creation of UI easier.

This project also adds several high-level widgets to make getting started with complex pages, such as settings menus, faster.
